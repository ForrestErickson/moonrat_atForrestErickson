To upload the code contained in this folder (MinicubatorCode_MinicubatorTeam_Cycle5.ino) to your Arduino circuit board, 
first open the code in the Arduino software. Plug in your circuit board to your computer using the necessary adaptor. 
Ensure that the software is set to  the correct board (Tools>Board>...), correct bootloader (Tools>Processor>...), 
and correct port (Tools>Port>...). 
Once connected properly, click the arrow pointing to the right in the top left of the code window 
to compile and upload your code to the board. Once this process is complete, you can remove the board and your Arduino will run the code as long as it has power.
