Moonrat: A second-generation portable incubator



## Motivation

By building a small, portable, intelligent incubator that can maintain constant elevated temperature, a variety of biological experiments and assays can be 
performed "in the field" without having access to a electric grid power.

## Origin

This is an offshoot of the [Rapid E. coli project](https://github.com/PubInv/rapid-e-coli). It is an attempt to build a better, smaller, more intelligent 
portable incubator that the Armadillo, described [elsewhere](http://jhe.ewb.org.au/index.php/jhe/article/view/127) and buildable from an [instructable](https://www.instructables.com/id/Portable-Petrifilm-Incubator-for-Inexpensive-In-Fi/).
