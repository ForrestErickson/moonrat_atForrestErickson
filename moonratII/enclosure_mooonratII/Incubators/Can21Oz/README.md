### Construction
It is fabricated out of a 21oz can which held fruit.  
The can empty weight is 62gm. assumed to be steel  
The can when full of water is 600 to 649 gm.  
The water mass is therefor about 587 gm  
The sides of the can are insulated with a layer of bubble wrap about 3/8 inch think.  
The top is open.  
The can is sitting on a 3 1/2" thick 89 mm polystyrine foam block.  



### Can Dimensions
Radius = (3 3/8)/2 = 1.6875" = 42.9mm  
Height = 4 1/2 " =  114.3mm  
Volume = Pi * R^2 * H = Pi* 42.9^2 * 114.3 = 331,000 mm^3  
Surface Area = (2 * Pi * R^2) + (2 * pi * R * H) = 11,560 + 30,810 = 42,370 mm^2
